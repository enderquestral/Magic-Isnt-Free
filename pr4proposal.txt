Project title: Magic isn't Free

Idea: I'll be using the 'Adventure' base to construct this game. I'll be taking heavy inspiration from the show
"Puella Magi Madoka Magica," in that you are a person with magical powers sent out to fight "Witches."
You will be entering complex "labrynths" to fight powerful Witches and their familiars, and uncover a plot along the way. 

I have no plans for working with a partner for right this moment, but if someone would be well suited for this project, I would love to work with them!


40 POINTS:
- Magic (4 points. Mana runs out, use greif seeds to heal. You have your basic attack, light attacks, dark attacks (witch attacks?))
- Characters (4 points. Kyuubey, 2 allies to talk to.)
- Levelling up (4 points. Kill more underlings, level up, melee and magic get stronger.)
- Helper (Kyuubey. 4 points.)
- Player attributes (3 points. Have Health, Mana, Strength, MagicalStrength, Grief...)
- More monsters (3 points. 3 types of underlings, 1 type of boss.)
- Victory condition (3 points. Beat all 3 witches.)
- Healing items (2 points, Grief Seeds for Mana (add Greif) and Favorite_food_insert for Health)
 
- Special rooms (Break rooms, Boss rooms (no running), Healing rooms, Nightmare Rooms (get plot item, but have to fight a miniboss for it))
- Modifying the world (4 points. If you read items/greif stat gets too high, different/more enemies show up in the world? Stat changes? Need to use items found within the laberynth to set up distractions for the witch)

Other possible things:
- Multiple endings (?? points)
- Multiple labrynths, "safe zone" to talk with other characters (?? points)
